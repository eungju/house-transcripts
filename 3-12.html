Cuddy's inside. House limps inside, pushing open the doors with his cane.]<br><br>HOUSE: [cheerfully] How can I help you this beautiful morning?<br><br>CUDDY: You got any cases?<br><br>HOUSE: [pretending to think] Three. Got a teenage African-American lung transplant... [starts to count with his fingers]<br><br>CUDDY: [cutting him off] Next few days, you'll be doing nothing but clinic work.<br><br>HOUSE: I just said...<br><br>CUDDY: You were lying.<br><br>HOUSE: Then why'd you ask?<br><br>CUDDY: Because if you told the truth, I was gonna give you only one day of clinic duty.<br><br>HOUSE: That's dishonest. In refuse to participate in this...<br><br>CUDDY: [firm] You'll do it. You owe me. [smugly] I kept you out of jail, I can put you back.<br><br>[House knows he's beaten. He starts to leave.]<br><br>HOUSE: [over his shoulder] Perjurer.<br><br>CUDDY: [right back at ya] Felon.<br><br>[House exits.]<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Clinic, Exam Room Two. House enters. An African-American man (AKA "Runny-nose Guy") is inside.]<br><br>HOUSE: How can I help you this beautiful morning?<br><br>RUNNY-NOSE GUY: I-I told the nurse I have a runny nose... but I don't. I think I have, uh, syphilis or gonorrhea.<br><br>[The camera pans across House's back, as we...]<br><br><br>MERGE WITH:<br><br>[Clinic, Exam Room Three. Speaking to House now is a twenty-something attractive lady, who seems upset.]<br><br>LADY (EVE): I think I have an STD.<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Clinic, Exam Room One. House turns around to face his next patient - a woman (AKA "Bashful Old Lady") in her late<br>sixties.]<br><br>BASHFUL OLD LADY: I think I have a... [points downwards]<br><br>[House says nothing. Expressionlessly, he reaches for the rubber glove dispenser. He pulls out one, then two, then thinks it wise to pull out one more.]<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Nurse's Station/Clinic Waiting Room. House limps over to the station, holding a swab (of what is anyone's guess) at arm's length in disgust. He drops it on the counter for the nurse to handle. He moves over to the waiting room and addresses the "sick people".]<br><br>HOUSE: Who is here for a runny nose?<br><br>[A few people raise their hands.]<br><br>HOUSE: It's a cold! It'll get better. Go home!<br><br>[The "runny-nose" people leave.]<br><br>HOUSE: Those of you who have stayed obviously do not have colds.<br><br>[As House speaks, one of the patients (AKA "Ear Guy") is scratching his right ear a bit too hard. Cuddy comes out of her office, having heard House's tirade.]<br><br>HOUSE: You'll be assigned a doctor, who is not me, 'cause I'm tired of wiping crotches.<br><br>CUDDY: [striding up to House] House! You're doing this.<br><br>[House is about to plead his case, when suddenly Ear Guy jumps up screaming to high heaven, clutching his right ear, giving everyone a start. Clutching his head in his hands (like it's about to explode), he starts to run "agony laps" around the nurse's station in agony.]<br><br>EAR GUY: [screaming] It hurts!<br><br>NURSE: [trying to calm him down] Sir...<br><br>[The nurse tries to stop him, but he keeps running, still screaming bloody murder. Cuddy has no luck in stopping him. She looks at House. House only watches with interest as the guy runs another agony lap.]<br><br>CUDDY: [to nurse] Call security.<br><br>[House limps over to the pharmacy, just as Ear Guy makes another lap.]<br><br>PHARMACIST (MARKO): Should I get a sedative?<br><br>HOUSE: No, I'm good, thanks.<br><br>[Ear Guy, still screaming, is about to finish another lap. Marko goes to get the sedative, regardless of how House feels. Cuddy looks afraid. House picks out for a syringe from the pharmacy.]<br><br>EAR GUY: [high-pitched] Head on fire!!<br><br>[House swings his cane in front of Ear Guy, tripping him, dropping him to the floor, where he continues to scream and writhe in agony. House goes up to him with the syringe, tossing Cuddy his cane. He jabs his knee into the man's ribs to keep him steady. He pulls out the syringe cap with his teeth and sticks the syringe into the guy's behind. The screaming and writhing stop almost immediately. Cuddy kneels down to check on the guy. When she turns him over, she sees his face is still contorted with agony.]<br><br>HOUSE: [calling] Need a team here!<br><br>MARKO: I have the sedative!<br><br>CUDDY: Little late.<br><br>HOUSE: [taking the sedative] Just in time.<br><br>CUDDY: What did you give him?<br><br>HOUSE: Paralytic.<br><br>CUDDY: Why would you do that?!<br><br>HOUSE: Somebody had to stop the screaming.<br><br>CUDDY: Then he's still in pain.<br><br>[House injects the sedative in the guy's arm.]<br><br>HOUSE: Yeah! But quietly.<br><br>[A team comes up with a stretcher.]<br><br>HOUSE: [to them] Paralytic stopped him breathing. He goes hypoxic, he's gonna be quiet forever.<br><br>[Cuddy and House move out of the way, as the emergency medics go to work on Ear Guy. House limps up to a quietly-seething Cuddy.]<br><br>HOUSE: So, either I can continue to swab people's privates, or I can figure out if this guy's delirium, pain and insanely high heart-rate are life-threatening or just a personality quirk.<br><br>[Cuddy gives him a resigned look.]<br><br>HOUSE: I think the latter choice is better for all three of us.<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Opening credits.]<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Ear Guy's room. He's hooked up to life-support and awake.]<br><br>FOREMAN: [vo] He's sedated. It took five cc's of haliperidol to get him down after the paralytic wore off.<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Diagnostics office. House confers with the Ducklings on Ear Guy's case.<br><br>HOUSE: So, pain in his right ear, psychotic behaviour and dizziness. Go!<br><br>CHASE: Nurses said he was holding his head. How d'you know it was specifically his ear?<br><br>HOUSE: Because he was dizzy. Means the problem was affecting his inner ear.<br><br>CAMERON: Nurses said he was running in circles. Doesn't mean he was dizzy.<br><br>HOUSE: He wasn't running in circles. He was running in oblongs. Looked like a three-year-old kid drew them.<br><br>FOREMAN: Acoustic Neuroma that started a haemorrhage.<br><br>HOUSE: 'Splains the pain, vertigo, everything. Get an MRI.<br><br>[Foreman looks victorious. Cameron shrugs. They get up to go.]<br><br>HOUSE: What else?<br><br>[They sit down, unsurely.]<br><br>FOREMAN: If it explains everything, what...?<br><br>HOUSE: It might not explain everything.<br><br>CHASE: What if he was psychotic first? Then self-mutilated, damaged the ear.<br><br>HOUSE: Excellent. Need a complete psychiatric work-up.<br><br>[They get up to go.]<br><br>HOUSE: [to Cameron] Your turn.<br><br>CAMERON: Uhh, I was... gonna say what Foreman...<br><br>HOUSE: Well, say something else.<br><br>CAMERON: [opening the file] He... came to the clinic.<br><br>HOUSE: [patronizing] Goood...<br><br>CAMERON: [bit more confident] Decent chance he had a chronic illness first, 'specially given the rapid heart rate.<br><br>[Foreman raises a skeptical eyebrow.]<br><br>HOUSE: [seems impressed] Hmm.<br><br>CAMERON: [even more confident] Lingering ear infection. Pressure builds up in his inner ear, bursts through the<br>mastoid bone while he's waiting in the clinic.<br><br>HOUSE: [almost imitating an orgasm] Ohhh, yes! Get a head CT, draw a blood culture, run a chem panel and get a complete blood count.<br><br>[They start to leave. House moves towards his office.]<br><br>HOUSE: Oh, while you're at it, pour some alcohol into his ear and take out the cockroach.<br><br>[The Ducklings look nonplussed.]<br><br>FOREMAN: He has a cockroach in his ear?<br><br>HOUSE: [collecting his coat from his office] He was scratching that ear right before the event, so I took a peek. My guess is, it started biting.<br><br>CAMERON: [wearily] Nothing else wrong with him?<br><br>HOUSE: Wasn't that enough? Pretty gross.<br><br>CHASE: So, why are we doing the tests?<br><br>HOUSE: Well, it's either that or I have to keep doing clinic duty. Do the tests or just stay out of Cuddy's sight, I don't really care which.<br><br>[Foreman and Chase leave, while Cameron tosses the file back onto the table.]<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Jogging park. House sits on a picnic table. The extracted pea-sized bug skitters across his hand, as he blows gently on it. Wilson approaches.]<br><br>WILSON: Why are you here?<br><br>HOUSE: [shooing away the bug] Because it's not a hospital.<br><br>WILSON: It's a jogging park. You're not jogging. You can't jog.<br><br>HOUSE: Watching jogging. I sit, I watch, I imagine.<br><br>[With a slight smile, Wilson sits on the table next to House.]<br><br>WILSON: So... what do you watch for?<br><br>HOUSE: [motioning] That guy's running in shorts.<br><br>[Wilson turns to see the guy "jogging" past two female joggers.]<br><br>WILSON: He's not jogging, he's trolling.<br><br>HOUSE: [smiles in approval] You're good at this.<br><br>WILSON: How long are you goin' to stay here?<br><br>HOUSE: Beauty of this place is that it's the last place Cuddy will look.<br><br>[Wilson smiles and nods.]<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[PPTH. Clinic, Exam Room. A balding shabby-looking homeless old man sits on the table. Cameron enters cheerily.]<br><br>CAMERON: How can I help you?<br><br>HOMELESS OLD GUY: The doctors gave me this. [produces a note]<br><br>CAMERON: [taking the note] What doctors?<br><br>HOMELESS OLD GUY: At the other hospital. Last month.<br><br>[Cameron peruses the paper. She then looks up somberly at him.]<br><br>CAMERON: [gently] Do you know what this is?<br><br>HOMELESS OLD GUY: Yes.<br><br>CAMERON: [reading] "Patient has a six centimetre mass in the right lung. Cancerous. Inoperable." Do you understand what this means?<br><br>HOMELESS OLD GUY: Is it okay if I sleep here tonight?<br><br>[Cameron looks at him, sympathetically.]<br><br>HOMELESS OLD GUY: It's cold outside.<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Outside Exam Room/Nurse's Station. Cameron walks outside, feeling a bit morose. She walks over to the nurse's station. Cuddy, at the station, sees her.]<br><br>CUDDY: What're you doing here? Thought House had a case.<br><br>CAMERON: He doesn't.<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Jogging park. House lies spread out on the picnic table (almost resembling Christ on the Crucifix). Cuddy walks up and leans over him, looking directly at him.]<br><br>CUDDY: You ordered a CT on a patient with a bug in his ear?<br><br>HOUSE: How'd you know I was here?<br><br>CUDDY: Ran into Cameron in the clinic.<br><br>HOUSE: [getting up] "Ran into"?<br><br>CUDDY: You ordered pointless tests just to...<br><br>HOUSE: Wouldn't've been pointless if you didn't "run into" Cameron.<br><br>CUDDY: She got punished. She's stuck with another dying patient.<br><br>[House pops a pill.]<br><br>CUDDY: [what the...!] Is that Vicodin?<br><br>HOUSE: Breath mint. Thought you were gonna kiss me.<br><br>CUDDY: What happened to rehab?<br><br>HOUSE: I got out.<br><br>CUDDY: [understanding, sighing in exasperation] It was a scam?<br><br>HOUSE: Enough foreplay. You gonna kiss me or not?<br><br>CUDDY: You are going back to the clinic. Or jail.<br><br>HOUSE: [amused] You perjured yourself to keep me out of jail. How're you...?<br><br>CUDDY: I only did that because I thought you were getting clean.<br><br>HOUSE: So it's do clinic duty or go to jail.<br><br>CUDDY: Yes.<br><br>HOUSE: Then it'll be finish your paperwork or go to jail. Help with fundraising or go to jail. Do your job or go to jail. I think I'd rather go to jail.<br><br>[He grabs his cane and gets off the table, walking past Cuddy.]<br><br>CUDDY: [turning to him] You owe me.<br><br>[House looks at her; she gives him a smug look. House relents.]<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[PPTH. Clinic, Exam Room.]<br><br>[POV: Patient's (AKA "Sherlock Nose") nostril. House looks through an otoscope at the screen.]<br><br>HOUSE: Bea-utiful.<br><br>SHERLOCK NOSE: Thank you. It's dry.<br><br>HOUSE: Who cares. It's beautiful.<br><br>[Camera moves from the nostril into the exam room. House rolls his chair to the table to change the lens on the otoscope.]<br><br>HOUSE: If my lawn was half as well maintained as that, pigeons wouldn't have the nerve to poop on it.<br><br>SHERLOCK NOSE: Good grooming is important.<br><br>HOUSE: Is that a shot?<br><br>SHERLOCK NOSE: [calm and collected] People do judge you on your appearance.<br><br>[House rolls the chair back to Mr. Nose.]<br><br>SHERLOCK NOSE: When you entered, I noted your shirt hadn't been pressed; you hadn't shaved in quite some time.<br><br>[House looks into his nose using the otoscope.]<br><br>SHERLOCK NOSE: I extrapolated you were a person for whom detail is not a major concern. I was worried you might apply the same standard in your work.<br><br>HOUSE: [interrupting] You use toe-nail clippers up there?<br><br>SHERLOCK NOSE: They're longer, so they allow me to better reach the upper hairs.<br><br>HOUSE: I am wearing a rumpled shirt, and I forgot to brush my hair this week. You've got athlete's foot in your nose.<br><br>[Sherlock seems appalled. He moves his hand to his nose, but self-consciously puts it back down.<br><br>HOUSE: [coolly] I'm ready to be judged.<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Waiting area. Cuddy's at the pharmacy. House slaps a file on the counter and addresses the "sick people" again.]<br><br>HOUSE: Okay! Fifty dollars...!<br><br>[Cuddy turns around to look at House.]<br><br>HOUSE: ...to any patient who's willing to leave here right now.<br><br>[Cuddy has a bewildered look on her face. An African-American man (AKA "Fifty-buck Dad") seems interested. He motions to his bespectacled eight-year-old kid (AKA "Fifty-buck Son").]<br><br>DAD: Get your stuff.<br><br>CUDDY: House! You can't...<br><br>HOUSE: My money.<br><br>CUDDY: I don't care. People do not...<br><br>HOUSE: [handing over $50 to the dad] They leave, fifty bucks. They're not all that sick. [looks at the people]<br><br>[Dad and son leave.]<br><br>CUDDY: Or they're poor.<br><br>[House gets rid of another patient.]<br><br>CUDDY: And desperate. Which was why this place is here.<br><br>HOUSE: If they're that poor, then they'd rather have fifty bucks.<br><br>[A well-dressed old guy walks up, coughing into his handkerchief.]<br><br>OLD GUY: [hoarsely] Can I have the money?<br><br>[House grabs the old guy's hand, which holds the kerchief, to show Cuddy. The kerchief is monogrammed "DS" and has a small blood stain near the monogram.]<br><br>HOUSE: Look. It's monogrammed. He doesn't need money. Ergo, he's not sick.<br><br>CUDDY: And the blood?<br><br>HOUSE: [shrugging it off] Could be anybody's. Monogram's definitely his.<br><br>[House hands him the fifty bucks. The old guy leaves happily.]<br><br>CUDDY: [smiling (for the sake of appearances)] We need to talk.<br><br>[They walk towards her office.]<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Cuddy's Office. Cuddy opens the door, followed by House.]<br><br>HOUSE: [melodramatically] Doesn't matter what you say, do or threaten. I will find a way out.<br><br>CUDDY: How can we make this more interesting for you?<br><br>HOUSE: How can we make the sky green? How can we make the tall short? You cannot make the uninteresting interesting.<br><br>CUDDY: [with a crooked smile, enticing] I'll pay you ten dollars for every patient you diagnose without touching.<br><br>[House is definitely intrigued.]<br><br>CUDDY: You pay me ten dollars for every one you have to touch.<br><br>HOUSE: You're making this into a game for me. From which I can only conclude this isn't a game for you.<br><br>CUDDY: No.<br><br>HOUSE: Why? Think if I deal with enough people, I'll find some humanity?<br><br>CUDDY: Yes.<br><br><br>[And so it begins. The following montage is filmed using a handheld camera.]<br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Clinic, Exam Room. A patient (AKA "Tongue Guy") is pressing his tongue down himself, with a tongue depressor. House sits in front of him, looking down his throat.]<br><br>TONGUE GUY: Wha' ah ha' todo 'is mahsulf? (Why do I have to do this myself?)<br><br>HOUSE: I got a bum leg. Say "Aah".<br><br>TONGUE GUY: Aaahhh-aahh.<br><br>[House grimaces as he looks into his throat.]<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Clinic, Exam Room. A lady (AKA "Stomach Lady") sleeps on the table, her shirt pulled up to her midriff. She feels the area around the solar plexus. House sits nearby (no touching!).]<br><br>STOMACH LADY: Feels rough.<br><br>HOUSE: Yes! It's a rash. Can't get any more than "rough".<br><br>STOMACH LADY: [exasperated to have to do it herself] Well, [mutters] it's just rough. Can't you feel it?<br><br>HOUSE: Well, I could. But then, what satisfaction would you get?<br><br>[She keeps rubbing her solar plexus.]<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Clinic, Exam Room. A teenage patient (AKA "Pulse Dude") sits on the table, trying to find a pulse on his left arm.]<br><br>PULSE DUDE: Got it.<br><br>HOUSE: [checking his watch] Start counting.<br><br>[Pulse Dude starts counting mentally.]<br><br>HOUSE: [two seconds later] How many?<br><br>PULSE DUDE: T-twenty six.<br><br>[House, astonished, mouths the word "twenty", closes his eyes and purses his lips.]<br><br>HOUSE: Okay. Either you suck at math, or you're gonna die in two seconds. [waits a couple of seconds mock-expectantly] You suck at math.<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Nurse's station/Clinic. House limps to the station, file in hand. Cuddy's there, signing something.]<br><br>HOUSE: Diagnosis! [slaps the file down, picks up another] Prescription! [to Cuddy] You owe me thirty.<br><br>[Cuddy smiles in the background. House limps to the Exam Room One. He opens the door to find a really attractive lady sitting there (might I add, wearing a low-cut dress!). She smiles at House and waits expectantly. House closes the door, with a dubious expression on his face.]<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Nurse's station. House approaches Cuddy from behind.]<br><br>HOUSE: I owe you ten.<br><br>[Cuddy smiles, giving him a "I-guessed-as-much" look.]<br><br>CUDDY: [holding up a file] Test results are back for your STD patients. I'm not paying you for them. You already touched them.<br><br>[House considers it and limps off.]<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Clinic, Exam Room. House slaps the file on to a cart. Runny-nose Guy is back.]<br><br>HOUSE: How old are you?<br><br>RUNNY-NOSE GUY: Thirty.<br><br>HOUSE: And you've never seen an after-school special? Dawson's Creek? How do you get to thirty and not know about condoms?<br><br>RUNNY-NOSE GUY: [rattled] Oh God, I h... I have an STD.<br><br>HOUSE: No. But you will. Every patient who comes in here for an STD test has one thing in common. They had SWS. "Sex While Stupid".<br><br>[The camera pans across quickly as we...]<br><br><br>MERGE WITH:<br><br>[Clinic, Exam Room. House testily addresses Bashful Old Lady.]<br><br>HOUSE: [fatigued] How old are you?<br><br>BASHFUL OLD LADY: [looking down] Sixty.<br><br>HOUSE: [looks up in disbelief] You're lying. That's not the point. You've never seen Dawson's Creek?<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Clinic, Exam Room. House now speaks to Eve, who still seems upset.]<br><br>[TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE: Just so y'all know, Eve is upset throughout the episode. So I'm not going to write "EVE: [upset] yada yada" every time she speaks.]<br><br>HOUSE: And you've never seen an after-school special? How do you get to your age and not know about condoms?<br><br>EVE: I have an STD?<br><br>HOUSE: Yeah! You're actually the first one today. Lucky day. Not for you, but gotta feel good for everyone else.<br><br>[Eve drops her head and breaks down. She sobs loudly. House turns around.]<br><br>HOUSE: It's Chlamydia. As bad news goes, 's about the best.<br><br>[That doesn't seem to reassure her. She continues weeping quietly.]<br><br>HOUSE: Oh, settle down. It's treatable. It's actually curable.<br><br>[No effect. She seems to be getting even more worked up. House puts a couple of pills in a plastic cup.]<br><br>HOUSE: [no idea what to do] All you have to do is take these pills...<br><br>[He holds the plastic cup in front of her. Suddenly, she lashes out, almost savagely, knocking the cup and pills out of House's hand.]<br><br>EVE: DON'T TOUCH ME!!<br><br>[She glares at House. House looks at her and understands.]<br><br>HOUSE: [quietly] Oh God.<br><br>[Eve slows lowers her head.]<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Cuddy's office. Cuddy's at her desk. House enters.]<br><br>HOUSE: [seriously] I need someone to cover a patient.<br><br>CUDDY: House, you're committed to...<br><br>HOUSE: She was raped. [beat] Think I'm the right doctor for her?<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Aerial shot of PPTH. Day.]<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Clinic, Exam Room. Cuddy speaks with Eve, who sits huddled up on the table.]<br><br>CUDDY: We've assigned another doctor to your care.<br><br>EVE: I didn't mean to upset Dr. House.<br><br>CUDDY: He knows that. That's not why we're doing this.<br><br>EVE: I'd like to keep being treated by him.<br><br>CUDDY: [huh?] W-Why?<br><br>EVE: Just do.<br><br>CUDDY: Trust me, it's better if you deal with somebody who specialises...<br><br>EVE: I'm fine.<br><br>CUDDY: You told Dr. House it's been less than a week. You haven't told anyone other than him. Emotionally, you're still...<br><br>EVE: [getting mad] You know what I'm dealing with? You know what I'm going through?<br><br>CUDDY: [quietly] No. You think Dr. House does? [beat] I'm not suggesting either one of us be your doctor. Dr. Stone is psychiatri...<br><br>EVE: [resolute] If Dr. House is too busy, I could wait.<br><br>[Cuddy looks at her, resigned.]<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Clinic, Exam Room. Eve leans up against a wall. House sits on a stool at the other end of the room.]<br><br>HOUSE: Why do you want me?<br><br>EVE: I don't know.<br><br>HOUSE: [shrugging] I don't wanna treat you.<br><br>EVE: You're just saying that so I'll see the psychiatrist.<br><br>HOUSE: True. 'Cept for the word "just". I'm saying, I don't wanna treat you so you'll see the psychiatrist and because I don't wanna treat you.<br><br>[She walks forward and leans on the table, looking at him.]<br><br>EVE: Why don't you wanna treat me anymore?<br><br>HOUSE: I never wanted to treat you. Fact that you were raped [beat, sighs] holds no interest for me. It's nothing personal. There's nothing to treat. You're physically healthy.<br><br>EVE: [purses her lips] Okay.<br><br>[House nods and gets up to leave.]<br><br>EVE: [persistent] But I want you to be my doctor.<br><br>HOUSE: [turns] Why?<br><br>EVE: [shakes her head] I don't know.<br><br>HOUSE: You gotta have a reason. Everything has a reason.<br><br>EVE: I trust you.<br><br>HOUSE: Ah, see, that's a bad reason. 'Cause I'll lie to you. I'll tell you anything just to get you out of here.<br><br>EVE: I don't care. I wanna talk to you.<br><br>HOUSE: [lowers his head, moves towards her] Look, you were raped. All control was taken away from you. You're trying to find that control again. You want me because I don't want you.<br><br>EVE: [pissed] I'm raping you?<br><br>HOUSE: In a very non-invasive, more annoying than trauma...<br><br>EVE: [yelling] Get the hell out of here!<br><br>HOUSE: I'll send in Dr. Stone.<br><br>[He opens the door, looks at her and leaves.]<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Homeless Old Guy's Room. The man is in a bed, hooked up to monitors and IV lines. Cameron enters.]<br><br>HOMELESS OLD GUY: [drawling] I didn't consent to all this medicine.<br><br>CAMERON: You've been out on the streets. No treatment...<br><br>HOMELESS OLD GUY: I'm dying, there's no treatment for dying.<br><br>CAMERON: We can make you comfortable.<br><br>HOMELESS OLD GUY: Don't wanna be.<br><br>CAMERON: Why not?<br><br>HOMELESS OLD GUY: Because I screwed up my life.<br><br>CAMERON: So you wanna punish yourself for messing up your life?<br><br>HOMELESS OLD GUY: [appealing] Please, stop the treatment.<br><br>[Cameron looks at him.]<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Clinic, Exam Room. House is now attending to a new patient - a guy with hiccups (AKA "Hiccup Guy").]<br><br>HOUSE: It'll go away on it's own.<br><br>HICCUP GUY: It's not can... [hic]<br><br>HOUSE: No, it'll go away.<br><br>HICCUP GUY: [hoarse] It's been all day. There must be some treatment you...<br><br>HOUSE: Nope! It'll go away.<br><br>HICCUP GUY: [hic]<br><br>HOUSE: Or... it won't go away.

Anal-digital stimulation.<br><br>[He turns and sees Eve speaking with Dr. Stone in another room.]<br><br>HOUSE: How long has Stone been in with her?<br><br>CUDDY: Are you concerned?<br><br>HOUSE: You know how many people get raped everyday?<br><br>CUDDY: So it's common, therefore boring.<br><br>HOUSE: We were to care for every person suffering on the planet, life would shut down.<br><br>CUDDY: How 'bout just the ones we meet?<br><br>HOUSE: They deserve our sympathy more than the other people?<br><br>CUDDY: So your solution is not to give a damn about any of them? How do you do that? How do you take that theory<br>and put it in practice? You met her...<br><br>[House looks over her shoulder and sees something.]<br><br>HOUSE: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! Whoa!<br><br>[He runs off-screen. Cuddy looks behind in bewilderment.]<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[PPTH Lobby. It's the same father-son duo (Fifty-buck Dad and Son). The son is on a wheelchair, being wheeled in by a doctor. Dad is by his side. House limps over to them.]<br><br>HOUSE: Hey! [to the doctor] I paid these people fifty bucks to leave here an hour ago.<br><br>FIFTY-BUCK DAD: Yeah, we came back.<br><br>[The doctor seems puzzled.]<br><br>HOUSE: Then you owe fifty.<br><br>DOCTOR: The kid needs surgery.<br><br>HOUSE: [skeptically] And he could walk way back then. [to the son] Stand up, kid.<br><br>[The son stands.]<br><br>DOCTOR: He swallowed a magnet. We gotta cut it out.<br><br>HOUSE: How old are you?<br><br>FIFTY-BUCK SON: Eight.<br><br>HOUSE: And he swallowed something stuck to a fridge? Darwin says let him die.<br><br>[The dad gives him a WTF look.]<br><br>HOUSE: It's already below the stomach. It should pass on its own.<br><br>DOCTOR: Strong magnet. It's messing with the imaging. We have no way to...<br><br>[House kneels in front of the son and lifts up the kid's shirt, exposing his stomach.]<br><br>DOCTOR: Got X-ray vision, House?<br><br>[House thinks a bit, then reaches over and pulls out a scalpel. He removes the protective cover with his teeth.]<br><br>FIFTY-BUCK DAD: [scared] Whoa, whoa, whoa! You gonna cut him open? Right here?<br><br>[House doesn't incise, he just moves the scalpel slowly in front of the boy's stomach, near the belly-button. The dad starts freaking out. The doctor bends over to look. The scalpel sticks to the boy's stomach, left of his belly-button. The dad and the doctor look relieved.]<br><br>HOUSE: It's well into the intestines. He's fine. [takes the scalpel and stands] I want my fifty back.<br><br>[The dad starts rummaging through his pockets, when a shout is heard.]<br><br>DR. STONE: I need a crash cart!

STONE: [defensively] Nothing that would make her want to...<br><br>CUDDY: Heartbeat's irregular!<br><br>HOUSE: What did she say to you?<br><br>DR. STONE: Nothing. I gave her a couple sedatives, turned around, she grabbed the whole bottle.<br><br>[The emergency team starts to intubate.]<br><br>HOUSE: You must have said something.<br><br>DR.

She's asleep. Her hands are tied to the bed. House sits nearby, playing on his PSP. Eve wakes up. She sees House. She tries to raise her arm, but finds it tied to the bed. She drops her arms in frustration. House notices the movement. Keeping the PSP aside, he goes over to her and checks her pulse.]<br><br>HOUSE: You gonna do that again?<br><br>[She slowly shakes her head. He unstraps the binds around her left wrist.]<br><br>HOUSE: You're gonna be okay... physically.<br><br>EVE: Which is all that interests you.<br><br>[He goes over and undoes the bind on her right wrist.

Satisfied, he pockets the flashlight.]<br><br>HOUSE: Which brings us back to, why do you want me?<br><br>EVE: I don't know.<br><br>HOUSE: Tried to kill yourself 'cause you couldn't talk to me. Must have a reason.<br><br>EVE: [quietly] Why's there always have to be a reason? Can't we just talk?<br><br>HOUSE: [getting annoyed] There's a phone. Talk to a friend. Family-member.

You're the last person she should be talking to.<br><br>FOREMAN: She wants to talk about the weather, talk about the weather. She wants normalcy. She wants to feel like the world didn't end.<br><br>HOUSE: Right. I'll tell her that everything went on without her. Babies were born, people got married. Thousands of people will remember the day she got raped as the happiest day of their lives.<br><br>FOREMAN: You might not wanna phrase it quite that way.<br><br>CAMERON: You need to get her to talk about what happened.<br><br>FOREMAN: No, he doesn't.<br><br>CAMERON: [to Foreman] Pretending it didn't happen...<br><br>FOREMAN: Wrong! Pretending this didn't happen is the best thing she could possibly do.<br><br>CAMERON: [to House, firmly] She's gotta make this real.<br><br>FOREMAN: You know what we should be trying to make real or process? The few decent moments in our lives, not the crap.<br><br>CAMERON: [getting mad] Maybe you're right! Except there's no way she can pretend this didn't happen, so she has no choice but to process it.<br><br>[House considers this.]<br><br><br>CUT TO:<br><br>[Eve's room.

The fact that it did happen doesn't change anything. World doesn't suck anymore today than it did yesterday.<br><br>EVE: I know all that.<br><br>HOUSE: [no idea what to say] Then what do you want me to tell you?<br><br>EVE: Nothing. I just want to talk.<br><br>HOUSE: About nothing.<br><br>[She nods.]<br><br>HOUSE: We talk about nothing, nothing will change.<br><br>EVE: It might.<br><br>HOUSE: How?<br><br>EVE: Time. Time changes everything.<br><br>HOUSE: [trying to shrug it off] It's what people say. It's not true. Doing things changes things.

Has your life sucked? Tell her the truth. Tell her you were shot. Tell her...<br><br>HOUSE: She doesn't wanna hear the truth. She's looking for something. Looking to extrapolate something...<br><br>WILSON: She's looking to connect with you, and that's what's scaring the hell out of you. Tell her the truth.<br><br>HOUSE: There is no truth.<br><br>WILSON: [thinks] Are we role-playing? Am I you? I don't wanna be you.<br><br>HOUSE: She's not asking for test results. She's not asking what two plus two equals. She's asking for my personal life experience, so she can extrapolate the law of humanity.

And given how lousy you're responding, I assumed it was worse than getting abused by your grandmother.<br><br>[Eve sits up.]<br><br>EVE: What did she do to you?<br><br>HOUSE: Parents travelled a lot, leaving me with her. She liked things the way she liked them. She believed in discipline. She was right, I suppose. I hardly ever screwed up when she was around. Too scared of... being forced to sleep in the yard or take a bath in ice. [beat] Your turn.<br><br>EVE: Your parents, they-they never stopped her?<br><br>HOUSE: [sitting on a chair] Never told them.<br><br>EVE: Why not?<br><br>HOUSE: Usual reasons.

[beat] I opened up to you, you open up to me.<br><br>EVE: What did you call her?<br><br>HOUSE: Oma.<br><br>EVE: And you kept calling her that after this?<br><br>HOUSE: Dutch for "grandmother".

What do you care if it happened to me?<br><br>EVE: They're not in this room.<br><br>HOUSE: [loudly] No! They're out there! Doctors, lawyers,... postal workers! Some of them doing great, some of them doing lousy! You're gonna base your whole life on who you got stuck in a room with?<br><br>EVE: [stubborn] I'm gonna base this moment on who I'm stuck in a room with. It's what life is. It's a series of rooms. And who we get stuck in those rooms with adds up to what our lives are.<br><br>[They look at each other. The door slides open.

[getting up to pace around] Judging by the number of natural disasters, not to God either.<br><br>EVE: You're just being argumentative.<br><br>HOUSE: Yeah! I do do that. What about Hitler? Is his life sacred to God? Father of your child? Is his life sacred to you?<br><br>EVE: My child isn't Hitler.<br><br>HOUSE: Either every life is sacred or...<br><br>EVE: [shouts] Stop it!

Might makes sense for us to kill the ass that did this to you. But where do we draw the line? Which asses do we get to kill? Which asses get to keep on being asses? Nice thing about the abortion debate is we can quibble over trimesters, but ultimately there's an ice-cold line - birth. Morally, there isn't a lot of difference. Practically, huge.<br><br>EVE: You're enjoying this conversation.<br><br>HOUSE: [cracks a smile] This is the type of conversation I do well.<br><br>EVE: But the other type?

I couldn't live with that.<br><br>HOUSE: So you need to think that the guy that did this to you is gonna be punished.<br><br>EVE: I need to know that it all means something.
